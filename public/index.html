            <p>In order to participate, you first need to log in using GitHub, GitLab, or Google at the top right of the page. Hack-o-Ween works by randomly assigning each user their own unique input to every puzzle. When you're logged in, you'll see that the bottom of every puzzle page will have a link to your program's input. Write a program to solve that input, and submit your solution at the bottom of the puzzle's page.</p>
